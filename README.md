# Tool created to help converting .mp4 videos to gifs

Usage:
* 1. Install dependencies
  ``` npm i ```
* 2. If you're in Windows, click *run.bat*. If not, run ``` npm start ``` in terminal

> The converter will look for an .mp4 file at the root. So, make sure you only have the video you want to convert. 

Enjoy!
